# stabiliNNator

## proliNNator
### description
ProliNNator is a tool that predicts proline probabilities in protein structures using pre-trained neural networks. It takes a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file as input and outputs a PDB file with per-residue proline probabilities.

## disulfiNNate
### description
DisulfiNNate, similar to ProliNNator, utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze protein structures. A pre-trained model then processes these graphs to predict the likelihood of a disulfide bond forming between pairs of cysteine residues.
